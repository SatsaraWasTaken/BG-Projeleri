            for Kids Who Grew Up In 2000's & 2010's</i></h1>
    <p>From the rising influence of anime to the birth of internet animation, these shows exemplify the best in kids'
        cartoons at the turn of the century</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">1. The Marvelous
        Misadventures Of
        Flapjack (2008-2010)</h2>
    <img src="/1.jpeg" alt="photo_1" title="The Marvelous Misadventures Of Flapjack" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>Those looking for the missing link between the cartoons of the 2000s and those of the current decade need look no
        further than The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. The wacky, and sometimes gross, adventures of two pirates
        and a whale searching for the legendary Candied Mountain serve as a testing ground for many of the artists who'd
        go on to define the cartoons of the 2000s.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">2. The Fairly OddParents
        (2001-2017)
    </h2>
    <img src="/2.jpeg" alt="photo_2" title="The Fairly OddParents" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;">The Fairly OddParents ran for 15 years and 10 seasons.
        Unfortunately, most of the series was forgettable, jumping
        the tracks early on and continually getting worse. What 2000s kids will remember is the first four seasons when
        the show was actually good.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">3. The Spectacular Spider-Man
        (2008-2009)</h2>
    <img src="/3.jpeg" alt="photo_3" title="The Spectacular Spider-Man" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>Marvel might dominate the cinema, but in the world of cartoons, it always played second-fiddle to DC's creations.
        Their '90s cartoons didn't have the production value of Batman: TAS or Superman: TAS, and the current Disney XD
        offerings typically had a critical response of "okay" at best. Still, there's at least one Marvel cartoon that
        continued to have dedicated fans.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">4. Codename: Kids Next Door
        (2002-2008)</h2>
    <img src="/4.jpeg" alt="photo_4" title="Codename: Kids Next Door" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>Codename: Kids Next Door is a child's dream come true: an organization of children who fight against adult
        tyranny. Criminals such as homework-wielding teachers and vegetable-loving senior citizens never went
        unpunished, as "numbahed" operatives worked tirelessly to defend kids worldwide.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">5. Ben 10 (2005-2008)</h2>
    <img src="/5.jpeg" alt="photo_5" title="Ben 10" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>Prolific voice actress Tara Strong dominated the Western cartoon world with her versatile range and lengthy
        portfolio. She was the voice behind multiple main characters such as Raven from Teen Titans, Timmy Turner from
        Fairly OddParents, and even Bo from Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away. Once again, Strong lent her voice to play a
        mischievous ten-year-old boy with a mysterious alien "watch," and he instantly became a fan favorite.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">6. My Life As A Teenage Robot
        (2003-2009)</h2>
    <img src="/6.jpeg" alt="photo_6" title="My Life As A Teenage Robot" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>Nickelodeon's successful, risk-taking kids' animation dominated in the '90s, but for the most part, the 2000s
        Nicktoons didn't have the same staying power. This was the decade where SpongeBob SquarePants, the network's
        last great hit of the '90s, became so dominant that other cartoons, good or bad, were mostly ignored.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">7. Kim Possible (2002-2007)</h2>
    <img src="/7.jpeg" alt="photo_7" title="Kim Possible" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>There's no contest: Kim Possible was the best show on Disney Channel in the 2000s. Their live-action sitcoms
        didn't hold up outside a nostalgia trip, and many cartoons were pretty forgettable. Kim Possible, however, held
        up surprisingly well.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">8. Foster's Home For Imaginary
        Friends (2004-2009)</h2>
    <img src="/8.jpeg" alt="photo_8" title="Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>The Powerpuff Girls was still Craig McCracken's greatest success, but his second show, Foster's Home for
        Imaginary Friends, managed to do pretty well for itself, running for six seasons. From the title alone, one
        could tell there was something special about the show. A comedy about abandoned imaginary friends living
        together was an irresistible premise.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">9. Samurai Jack (2001-2017)</h2>
    <img src="/9.jpeg" alt="photo_9" title="Samurai Jack" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>If Avatar: The Last Airbender was the height of American TV cartoon storytelling in the 2000s, Samurai Jack was
        the height of American TV cartoon artistry. The plots were simple and archetypal, but the animation, sound
        design, and directing, were consistently mind-blowing.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- 9th -->

    <h2 style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">10. Avatar: The Last Airbender
        (2005-2008)</h2>
    <img src="/10.jpeg" alt="photo_10" title="Avatar: The Last Airbender" width="350px" height="200px">
    <p>Even if one didn't grow up in the 2000s, many were familiar with Avatar: The Last Airbender. Anyone from the age
        of six to 96 should be able to find something to enjoy about this series. While plenty of American cartoons took
        visual inspiration from anime in the past, Avatar was the first to really match the anime style of complex
        serialized storytelling. Great characters, detailed fantasy worldbuilding, serious themes, and deep respect for
        the Asian cultures that inspired it made Avatar a must-watch.</p>
